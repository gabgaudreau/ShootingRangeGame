# Shooting Range Game
Small aim practicing game I have developed in my free time.
The project is basically done at this point.
Missing some menu art as well as game sound and music, but all the logic I had planned for has been implemented.
View GameManager.cs end of file comments for things I would like to change.

# Practice your aim in a FPS Shooting Range.
